#  Challenge 18 ‚Äî Build a Bot

**Responsive Web Design Certification ‚Äì freeCodeCamp**

In this challenge, you learn how to **use JavaScript string concatenation** and variables to create a bot that introduces itself. The project demonstrates how to dynamically build sentences by combining strings and variable values.

##  Demo

The program outputs a series of sentences introducing a bot with its name, nickname, location, and favorite subject:

```

Hi there!
I am excited to talk to you.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is teacherBot.
I live in the universe.
My nickname is professorBot.
I love my nickname but I wish people would call me awesomeTeacherBot.
My favorite subject is Computer Science.
Well, it was nice to talk to you. Have a nice day!

##  Concepts Covered

- Declaring and assigning **variables** in JavaScript  
- Using **string concatenation** with the `+` operator  
- Updating variable values dynamically  
- Outputting content to the console with `console.log()`  

---

##  How It Works

1. **Declare variables** for bot name, location, nickname, and favorite subject.  
2. **Concatenate strings** with these variables to build complete sentences.  
3. Use `console.log()` to display each sentence in the console.  
4. Update variables as needed to simulate different bot names or nicknames.

##  How to Run

1. Copy the code into a file named `botIntroduction.js`.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file‚Äôs directory.  
3. Run the script using Node.js:  
   ```bash
   node botIntroduction.js
````

4. Observe the bot‚Äôs introduction printed line by line in the console.
