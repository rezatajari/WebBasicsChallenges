# CSS Color Markers

**Goal:**
Practice applying different CSS color values by creating a set of colored markers. Learn how to use **color names, hex codes, RGB, and HSL** to style elements consistently.

---

## Task

Create a web page that displays three markers with different colors. Each marker should be styled using a different method of setting color values in CSS.

---

## Requirements

* Create `index.html` and `styles.css` inside this folder
* Use at least three markers (e.g., div elements styled to look like markers)
* Apply colors using different methods:

  * **Color keyword** (e.g., `red`, `blue`)
  * **Hexadecimal** (e.g., `#FF0000`)
  * **RGB / RGBA** (e.g., `rgb(0, 255, 0)`)
  * **HSL / HSLA** (e.g., `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)`)
* Style the markers so they resemble actual highlighter markers (e.g., rectangular with rounded edges, centered text if needed)
* Experiment with **background colors, text colors, and complementary color pairs**
