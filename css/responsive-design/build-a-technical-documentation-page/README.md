# Build Technical Documentation Page 

## Project Overview
This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's **Responsive Web Design Certification** challenges. The objective of this challenge is to build a **technical documentation page** that is fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly. The page provides structured content for a technical topic, with a fixed navigation menu and smooth scrolling.

## User Stories
The project fulfills the following user stories:

1. **Main Documentation Area**  
   - The page contains a `<main>` element with `id="main-doc"` that holds the main content.

2. **Sections**  
   - At least five `<section>` elements with the class `main-section` are present.  
   - Each section has a `<header>` describing the topic.  
   - Each section has an `id` that matches its header text with underscores replacing spaces.

3. **Content Requirements**  
   - The sections include at least ten `<p>` elements, five `<code>` elements, and five `<li>` items total.  
   - Lists are properly nested inside `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

4. **Navbar**  
   - A `<nav>` element with `id="navbar"` contains a header and links.  
   - Links have the class `nav-link` and navigate to their corresponding sections.  
   - Navbar is fixed on the left side for desktops and remains visible during scrolling.

5. **Responsive Design**  
   - Media queries are used to make the page responsive on smaller screens.  
   - On mobile devices, the navbar moves to the top and the content fills the screen width.

6. **Styling**  
   - The project uses CSS for visual styling, including:  
     - Dark background for the navbar  
     - Smooth scrolling behavior  
     - Styled `<code>` elements  
     - Proper spacing and typography for readability

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Click on the links in the navbar to scroll smoothly to the corresponding section.  
3. Resize the browser window to see the responsive behavior of the page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (including Flexbox, positioning, and media queries)

## Project Status
✅ Completed and fully functional.  
✅ Responsive and visually structured.
