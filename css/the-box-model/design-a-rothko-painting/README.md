# Rothko Painting

Goal: Use CSS shapes, colors, shadows, borders, and transforms to create a Rothko-style abstract painting.

---

## Task
Build a painting effect using `<div>` elements and CSS. Apply:
- `background-color` for each colored block  
- `box-shadow` and `filter: blur()` for a painted effect  
- `border-radius` to soften edges  
- `transform: rotate()` for natural imperfections  
- Nested `<div>` structure (`frame` → `canvas` → blocks)  

---

## Requirements
- Create `index.html` and `styles.css`  
- Frame with border, canvas area inside  
- Three colored blocks styled with CSS  
- Use blur, shadows, and rotation for realism  

---

## Success Checklist
- [ ] Frame and canvas layout created  
- [ ] Three abstract blocks styled  
- [ ] Background colors applied  
- [ ] Shadows, blur, and rotation effects added
