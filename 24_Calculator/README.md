# Challenge 24 â€” Calculator

## Overview

In this challenge, you will build a simple JavaScript program that performs several basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and finding square roots.

This project helps you practice:

* Declaring and defining functions
* Using parameters and return values
* Handling arithmetic operations in JavaScript
* Using conditional statements to handle special cases (like division by zero)
* Displaying output with `console.log()`

---

## Objective

Create individual functions to perform basic arithmetic operations and display the results in the console.

---

## User Stories

1. Create a function named `calculateSum(num1, num2)` that returns the sum of two numbers.

2. Create a function named `calculateDifference(num1, num2)` that returns the difference between two numbers.

3. Create a function named `calculateProduct(num1, num2)` that returns the product of two numbers.

4. Create a function named `calculateQuotient(num1, num2)` that returns the quotient when the first number is divided by the second.

   * If `num2` is `0`, return `"Error: Division by zero"` instead of performing the calculation.

5. Create a function named `calculateSquare(num)` that returns the square of a number.

6. Create a function named `calculateSquareRoot(num)` that returns the square root of a number using `Math.sqrt()`.

7. Use `console.log()` to display the results of calling each function with various example values.

## How It Works

Each function takes one or two numeric arguments and performs the specified operation.
The program then prints the results to the console so you can verify that each function behaves correctly.
A conditional check prevents division by zero errors in the `calculateQuotient` function.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Node.js or any browser console environment
