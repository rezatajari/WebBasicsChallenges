# Challenge 22 â€” MathBot

## Overview

In this challenge, you will create a simple interactive bot called **MathBot** using JavaScript.
MathBot introduces various methods of the JavaScript `Math` object and demonstrates their behavior in a step-by-step, educational way.

This project helps you practice:

* Declaring and using variables
* Generating random numbers
* Rounding numbers up, down, and to the nearest integer
* Finding maximum and minimum values from a set of numbers
* Displaying informative messages in the console

---

## Objective

Create a program that:

1. Greets the user and introduces MathBot.
2. Explains the behavior of different `Math` methods.
3. Demonstrates generating random numbers within a specified range.
4. Shows how to round numbers up, down, and to the nearest integer.
5. Finds the maximum and minimum numbers from a set of values.
6. Guides the user through each concept with clear messages.

## User Stories

* MathBot should display a friendly greeting including its name.
* The program should explain how `Math.random()` works and show its output.
* The program should generate a random number between a minimum and maximum value.
* MathBot should demonstrate rounding numbers using methods that round down, up, and to the nearest integer.
* The program should demonstrate how to find the maximum and minimum numbers from a set.
* Each step should be clearly explained to help the user understand the concept.

## How It Works

* MathBot begins by introducing itself and greeting the user.
* It explains that `Math.random()` generates a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.
* The bot demonstrates generating random numbers within a specific range.
* It then shows how to round numbers down, up, and to the nearest whole number.
* MathBot finds and displays the maximum and minimum numbers from a set of values.
* Informative console messages guide the user through each step to create an interactive learning experience.

## Example Output

* A friendly greeting from MathBot introducing the Math object.
* Explanation and demonstration of generating random numbers.
* Random numbers within a given range.
* Rounded numbers using different rounding methods.
* Maximum and minimum values from a set of numbers.
* Summary message indicating the end of the learning session.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Node.js or browser console environment
