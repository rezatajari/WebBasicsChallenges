# 🏙️ Challenge 17 — Build a City

**Responsive Web Design Certification – freeCodeCamp**

Learn CSS Variables and Responsive Design by building a City Skyline using only HTML and CSS.  
This project demonstrates how to use CSS gradients, variables, and media queries to create a day-to-night skyline effect.

## 📸 Demo

A colorful city skyline that transitions from a bright sunny day to a calm night scene when the screen width is below 1000 pixels.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- CSS Variables for reusable colors and styles  
- Linear and radial gradients for backgrounds and lighting effects  
- The `background` shorthand for layering gradients  
- Flexbox for aligning and spacing buildings  
- Positioning with absolute and relative values  
- Repeating-linear-gradients for window patterns  
- Media queries for responsive design

## 🧩 Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | Contains the structure of the skyline including background and foreground buildings. |
| `styles.css` | Handles all styling, gradients, and color transitions for the city and sky. |
| `preview.png` | (Optional) Screenshot of the final skyline. |

## 🏗️ How It Works

The skyline is divided into two layers: background and foreground buildings.  
Each building is constructed with simple shapes, borders, and gradients.  
The sky uses a radial gradient to simulate the sun, while a media query changes the colors and gradients to create a night sky on smaller screens.  

When the browser width goes below 1000 pixels, the scene smoothly transitions from day to night.

## 🧱 Building Sections

### Background Buildings
Represent the distant skyline layer, designed with softer colors.

### Foreground Buildings
Add depth and contrast with more detailed shapes and window patterns.
