## Overview

**WebChallenges** is a personal learning repository where I document and practice I learn from frontend development. The goal is to reinforce learning through hands-on exercises and challenges, ensuring that theoretical knowledge translates into practical skills.

I primarily follow the [FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer), covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend technologies. Every challenge, small project, or experiment is added here to track progress and build a practical reference library.
