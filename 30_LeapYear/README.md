# Challenge 30 — Leap Year Calculator

## Overview

In this challenge, you will create a function that determines whether a given year is a **leap year**.
Leap years have an extra day in February (February 29) and follow specific rules.

This challenge helps you practice:

* Writing functions with parameters
* Using conditional logic (`if/else` or ternary operators)
* Returning formatted results as strings

---

## Objective

Build a function that takes a year as input and returns a message stating whether it is a leap year or not.

---

## Leap Year Rules

A year is considered a leap year if:

1. It is divisible by 4 → it may be a leap year.
2. If it is divisible by 100 → it is **not** a leap year.
3. If it is divisible by 400 → it **is** a leap year.

---

## User Stories

1. Define a function that accepts a numeric year as an argument.
2. Declare a variable outside the function to store the year you want to check.
3. Inside the function, use conditional logic to check if the year meets the leap year rules.
4. Return a string message indicating the result:

   * If it is a leap year, the message should state that the year is a leap year.
   * If it is not a leap year, the message should state that the year is not a leap year.
5. Call the function with the year variable and store the result in another variable.
6. Display the result to the console.

## Goal

At the end of this challenge, your program should be able to:

* Correctly determine if any given year is a leap year.
* Return a clear, formatted message for each case.
* Handle all edge cases according to the leap year rules.
