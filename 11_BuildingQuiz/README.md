# Challenge 11 â€” BuildingQuiz

Goal: Practice semantic HTML, forms, and accessibility features while styling with CSS.

## Task
Build an accessible quiz page with:
- A header containing logo, title, and navigation

- Form elements (text, email, date, radio, select, textarea)  
- Proper labels and associations (`for`, `id`, `fieldset`, `legend`)

- A styled footer with contact info  

---

## Requirements
- Create `index.html` and `styles.css`
