# Challenge 15 — Building Piano

**Goal:** Create a stylized piano keyboard using only HTML and CSS, including both white and black keys, and make it responsive for different screen sizes.

## Task

Build a piano webpage that includes:

* A **piano container** with background and rounded corners.
* **White and black keys** arranged in the correct order to resemble a real piano.
* A **logo** at the top of the piano.
* Proper **spacing and alignment** of all keys using CSS positioning and floats.
* **Responsive design** so the piano scales down on smaller screens.

## Requirements

* Create `index.html` and `styles.css`.
* Use `<div>` elements to create keys.
* Style black keys using pseudo-elements (`::after`).
* Apply proper CSS box-sizing, width, height, margins, and border-radius.
* Ensure the piano scales correctly with at least two breakpoints: small screens (`max-width: 768px`) and medium screens (`769px–1199px`).

## Success Checklist

* Piano container appears centered with rounded corners.
* White and black keys are correctly positioned and proportioned.
* Logo is displayed at the top of the piano.
* Pseudo-elements used for black keys styling.
* Layout is responsive and visually consistent across screen sizes.
* No images are used for keys — all drawn with HTML & CSS.
