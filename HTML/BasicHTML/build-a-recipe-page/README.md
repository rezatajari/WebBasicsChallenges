# Build a Recipe Page

## Objective

Create a functional HTML recipe page that demonstrates proper use of headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. The goal is to build a fully structured page that introduces a recipe, lists ingredients, and provides step-by-step instructions.

## Description

In this challenge, you are tasked with building a recipe page from scratch. The page should include a main heading, an introduction paragraph, sections for ingredients and instructions, and an image of the finished dish. You are encouraged to use real content and create your own style instead of copying an example project.

## What You Learned

* How to structure an HTML document using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
* Setting the language with `lang="en"` and defining character encoding with `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
* Using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) to organize content
* Writing descriptive paragraphs with `<p>`
* Creating unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients and ordered lists (`<ol>`) for instructions
* Adding images with `<img>` including proper `src` and `alt` attributes
* How to create a page that is both functional and semantically correct

## Expected Output

* A recipe page with a clear main heading showing the recipe name
* An introductory paragraph describing the recipe
* An image of the dish with a descriptive alt text
* A list of ingredients using an unordered list
* Step-by-step instructions using an ordered list

The finished page should be readable, well-structured, and fully functional in any browser.
