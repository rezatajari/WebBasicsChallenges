# Debug Camperbot’s Profile Page

## Objective

Fix syntax and tag errors in Camperbot’s HTML profile page so it follows proper HTML structure and valid tag usage.

## Description

Camperbot tried to create a simple profile page but made a few mistakes with HTML tags.
Your task in this challenge was to identify and correct those mistakes to ensure the page is semantically correct and passes all validation tests.

## What You Learned

* Correct use of valid HTML tags for structure and readability
* The difference between correct and invalid tags (e.g., `<h2>` vs. `<heading2>`, `<p>` vs. `<pp>`)
* How to properly close tags such as `<h3>`
* Importance of debugging syntax errors in HTML documents

## Fix Summary

1. Replaced invalid `<heading2>` with the correct `<h2>` tag.
2. Replaced invalid `<pp>` tags with the correct `<p>` tags for paragraphs.
3. Fixed the `<h3>` tag by properly closing it with `</h3>` instead of `<h3/>`.
