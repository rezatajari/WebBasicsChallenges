# Challenge 37 â€“ Build a Travel Agency Page

## Objective

Create a fully functional HTML travel agency page that presents destinations, packages, and top itineraries while following semantic HTML standards. The page should include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, figures, images, and meta information for accessibility and SEO.

## Description

In this challenge, you are tasked with building a travel agency landing page from scratch. The page should provide:

* An introduction to travel opportunities
* Available travel packages
* Highlighted top itineraries with images and captions

You are encouraged to give your page a personal style and use meaningful content instead of copying the example project.

## What You Learned

* Structuring a page using `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html lang="en">`
* Adding proper meta elements:

  * `<meta charset="utf-8">`
  * `<meta name="description">` for SEO
* Creating a title for your webpage using `<title>`
* Organizing content with headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and lists (`<ul>` and `<li>`)
* Wrapping text in anchor (`<a>`) elements with `href` and `target="_blank"`
* Using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to display images with descriptive text
* Adding images with meaningful `alt` attributes for accessibility
* Making a page that is both semantically correct and user-friendly

## Expected Output

* A travel agency page with a single main heading introducing destinations
* An introductory paragraph about travel opportunities
* A section titled "Packages" with a paragraph and an unordered list of **Group Travels** and **Private Tours**, each as a link opening in a new tab
* A section titled "Top Itineraries" with at least three figures, each containing:

  * An anchor linking to the learning page, opening in a new tab
  * An image with a valid `src` and descriptive `alt`
  * A `<figcaption>` describing the itinerary
