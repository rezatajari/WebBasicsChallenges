# Building Cat Painting

**Goal:** Use only HTML and CSS to draw a cat face by combining shapes, gradients, borders, and positioning. Practice building complex visuals without images or SVGs.

## Task

Create a web page that displays a stylized cat painting composed entirely of HTML elements styled with CSS. The design should include:

* **Cat head** shaped with borders, gradients, and border-radius.
* **Ears** built from rotated border triangles with inner ear details.
* **Eyes** with pupils and highlights for a realistic look.
* **Nose** created with a rotated triangle.
* **Mouth** drawn with curved border lines.
* **Whiskers** added using thin rectangles positioned around the mouth.

## Requirements

* Create `index.html` and `styles.css`.
* Use `<div>` elements structured semantically inside a `<main>` container.
* Apply CSS positioning (`absolute`, `relative`) to place facial features correctly.
* Use gradients and border techniques for texture and shape.
* No external images or SVGs — only HTML and CSS.

## Success Checklist

* Cat head appears centered on the page with gradient fill.
* Ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers are all drawn using CSS.
* All facial features are aligned and proportional.
* No images are used — the painting is entirely HTML & CSS.
* Layout remains consistent on different screen sizes.
