# Challenge 12 — Tribute Page

Goal: Build a tribute page that demonstrates semantic HTML, responsive images, and proper page structure.

---

## Task

Create a tribute page dedicated to a person of your choice. The page should contain:

* A main container (`#main`) holding all content
* A title (`#title`) and short description (`#tribute-info`)
* An image (`#image`) inside a figure (`#img-div`) with a caption (`#img-caption`)
* A timeline or list describing key events in the person’s life
* A relevant quote styled separately
* A link (`#tribute-link`) to an external resource about the person

---

## Requirements

* Use semantic HTML structure (`main`, `figure`, `figcaption`, `ul`, `blockquote`)
* Ensure `#img-div`, `#image`, `#img-caption`, `#tribute-info`, and `#tribute-link` are all **descendants of `#main`**
* Make the image responsive: `display: block`, `max-width: 100%`, `height: auto`, and centered with `margin: 0 auto`
* Style the layout with CSS for readability and spacing
* Ensure external link (`#tribute-link`) opens in a new tab with `target="_blank"`

---
