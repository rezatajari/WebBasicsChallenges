# Building Cafe Menu

**Goal:**
Practice structuring a web page with HTML and CSS by creating a café menu layout.

---

## Task

Create a web page that shows a café menu. The page should display menu items grouped by category (e.g. Coffee, Tea, Pastries), with prices, descriptions, and styled layout using CSS.

---

## Requirements

* Create `index.html` and `styles.css` inside this folder.
* Use at least:

  * One heading for the main title of the menu (e.g. “Café Menu”).
  * Subheadings for each category (e.g. “Coffee”, “Tea”, “Pastries”).
  * A list or section of **menu items**, each with:

    * a name
    * a description (short text)
    * a price
* Arrange the menu visually (using CSS) so it looks like a café menu:

  * Style font sizes, spacing, and alignment to be readable.
  * Use colors, borders or background to differentiate categories or items.
  * Make sure the layout is clean and organized (e.g. categories clearly separated).
