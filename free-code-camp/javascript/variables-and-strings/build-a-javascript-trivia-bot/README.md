# Build a Trivia Bot

**Responsive Web Design Certification – freeCodeCamp**

In this challenge, you create a **JavaScript bot** called **Trivia Bot** that shares fun facts about its favorite programming language. This project helps you practice **variables, string concatenation, and `console.log()`** statements.

---

## Demo

When you run the program, the console outputs a series of messages introducing the bot and sharing multiple fun facts:

```

Hello! I'm your coding fun fact guide!
My name is Codey and I live on the Internet.
My favorite programming language is JavaScript.
A fun fact about JavaScript is that it can run both on the client and server side.
Another fun fact: JavaScript was created in just 10 days!
And one more: Many popular frameworks like React use JavaScript.
It was fun sharing these facts with you. Goodbye! - Codey from the Internet.

## Concepts Covered

- Declaring and assigning **variables** with `let`  
- Using **string concatenation** to include variables in sentences  
- Reassigning variables to hold new values  
- Logging output to the console with `console.log()`

## How It Works

1. The bot **greets the user** with a welcome message.  
2. Variables are declared for **bot name**, **location**, and **favorite programming language**.  
3. The bot **introduces itself** using these variables.  
4. A `codingFact` variable is declared and assigned a **fun fact** about the bot’s favorite language.  
5. `codingFact` is **reassigned twice** to share additional facts.  
6. All messages are logged to the console, including a **farewell message**.

## How to Run

1. Copy the code into a file named `triviaBot.js`.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file’s directory.  
3. Run the script using Node.js:  
   ```bash
   node triviaBot.js

4. Enjoy the bot introducing itself and sharing fun programming facts in the console.
