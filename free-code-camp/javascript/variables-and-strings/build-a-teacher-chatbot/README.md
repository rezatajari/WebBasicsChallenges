# Teacher Chatbot

This project is a **JavaScript console chatbot** designed to teach string manipulation concepts such as template literals, string length, character access, and substring positions. It demonstrates how to dynamically build sentences and use string properties in JavaScript.

---

## Demo

When you run the program, the console outputs a series of explanations and examples, including:

- A greeting from the bot
- Introduction to string manipulation concepts
- Examples of using string length
- Examples of accessing first, second, and last characters of words
- Examples of finding positions of substrings within sentences
- A farewell message

---

## Concepts Covered

- **Template literals** for dynamic sentence creation  
- **String length** to determine the number of characters in a word or phrase  
- **Accessing characters** using bracket notation to get specific letters  
- **Finding substring positions** to locate words or phrases within a sentence

## How It Works

1. The bot introduces itself to the user.  
2. Example words are presented to demonstrate string properties.  
3. The program dynamically constructs sentences using template literals.  
4. It shows how to determine the length of strings.  
5. It demonstrates accessing the first, second, and last characters of a string.  
6. It locates substrings within a sentence using position-finding methods.  
7. The bot concludes with a friendly farewell.

## How to Run

1. Copy the project into a file named `stringBot.js`.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the fileâ€™s directory.  
3. Run the script using Node.js.  
4. Observe the interactive console output from the bot.
