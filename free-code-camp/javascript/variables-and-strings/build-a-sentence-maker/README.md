# Story Maker

**Responsive Web Design Certification – freeCodeCamp**

In this challenge, you create a **JavaScript program** that generates dynamic stories using **variables and string concatenation**. This project helps you practice updating variable values and building sentences dynamically.

---

## Demo

When you run the program, the console outputs **two stories** using the same story template but with different variable values:

```

First story: Once upon a time, there was a(n) fierce dragon who loved to eat sheep. The dragon lived in a mountain and had fiery nostrils that blew fire when it was flying.

Second story: Once upon a time, there was a(n) happy unicorn who loved to eat cookies. The unicorn lived in a rainbow and had sparkly nostrils that blew fire when it was dancing.

````

## Concepts Covered

- Declaring and assigning **variables** with `let`  
- Updating variables to hold **new values**  
- Using **string concatenation** to create sentences dynamically  
- Outputting content to the console with `console.log()`  

---

## How It Works

1. Declare variables: `adjective`, `noun`, `verb`, `place`, `adjective2`, and `noun2`.  
2. Assign initial values to the variables and use a **story template** to build the first story.  
3. Log the first story to the console.  
4. Reassign the variables with new values for the second story.  
5. Build the second story using the same template.  
6. Log the second story to the console.

## How to Run

1. Copy the code into a file named `storyMaker.js`.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file’s directory.  
3. Run the script using Node.js:  
   ```bash
   node storyMaker.js
````

4. Enjoy seeing two dynamic stories printed in the console.
