### Multimedia Page

This project demonstrates how to use HTML multimedia elements to create a page that plays both a video and an audio track. The goal is to understand how to structure a simple webpage that integrates interactive media content using semantic HTML elements.

#### Objective

Build a multimedia app that meets all the following user stories and passes the test requirements.

#### User Stories

1. The page should include an **h1** element that serves as the main title.
2. There should be **two section** elements to separate the video and audio content.
3. Inside the first section, include an **h2** element that provides a title for the video.
4. Below the **h2**, add a **video** element with the **controls** and **width** attributes (set width to 640).
5. The **video** element should contain a **source** element with a valid **src** and **type** attribute.

   * You can use:
     `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/What is the map method and how does it work.mp4`
6. Inside the second section, include an **h2** element for the audio title.
7. Below that, add an **audio** element with the **controls** and **loop** attributes, and a **src** pointing to a valid audio file.

   * You can use:

#### Goal

Create a web page that is functionally similar to the example project but reflects your own personal style. The project should use proper semantic HTML structure and provide an engaging way to showcase video and audio media on a single page.
