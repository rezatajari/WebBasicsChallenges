### Challenge 38 — SVG Heart Icon

This challenge focuses on creating and displaying a **Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)** icon directly within an HTML document. SVGs are resolution-independent graphics used widely in modern web design for icons, logos, and illustrations.

#### Objective

Build a simple web page that displays a red heart icon using inline SVG.

#### User Stories

1. The page should begin with a proper `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
2. The root element should be an `<html>` tag with the `lang` attribute set to `"en"`.
3. Include a `<head>` element containing:

   * A `<meta>` element with `charset="UTF-8"`.
   * A `<title>` element set to **"Heart Icon"**.
4. Inside the `<body>`, create an inline `<svg>` element to define the heart icon.
5. The `<svg>` element should include the following attributes:

   * `fill="red"` to give the heart its color.
   * `width="24"` and `height="24"` to define its dimensions.
   * `viewBox="0 0 24 24"` to establish its coordinate system.
6. Inside the `<svg>`, use a `<path>` element with the `d` attribute defining the heart’s shape.

#### Goal

Successfully render a red heart icon using inline SVG, demonstrating understanding of vector-based graphics in HTML. This exercise builds foundational knowledge for integrating icons and scalable artwork into web interfaces without relying on external image files.
