# Challenge 28 — Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

## Overview

In this challenge, you will build a simple JavaScript function that converts temperatures from **Celsius** to **Fahrenheit**.
This exercise helps reinforce your understanding of basic arithmetic operations, function creation, and return values in JavaScript.

The conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit is a common task in many applications, from weather apps to temperature monitoring systems.

This project helps you practice:

* Writing and calling JavaScript functions
* Performing mathematical calculations
* Returning and displaying numerical results

---

## Objective

Create a function that receives a temperature in Celsius and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit, using the correct conversion formula.

---

## Formula

To convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, use this mathematical relationship:

> Fahrenheit = Celsius × (9/5) + 32

This formula multiplies the Celsius temperature by 1.8 (which is 9 divided by 5) and then adds 32 to adjust for the Fahrenheit scale.

---

## User Stories

1. You should create a function named **`convertCtoF`**.
2. The function should take one numeric argument — the temperature in Celsius.
3. The function should calculate and return the temperature in Fahrenheit.
4. The returned value must be a number (not a string or text).

---

## How It Works

1. The program takes a Celsius temperature as input.
2. It applies the conversion formula to calculate the Fahrenheit equivalent.
3. The result is returned from the function and can be logged or displayed.

---

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Node.js or any browser console environment

---

## Goal

When you run your function, it should correctly convert any temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit, following the standard conversion formula.
